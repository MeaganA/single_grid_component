# single_grid_component_webpage
Frontend development practice project of frontendmentor.io

This practice project was provided by frontendmentor.io. I was practicing formatting the site as described in the figma file. My challenge throughout this project was finding out how to make the website look organized while maintaining the smaller components like the font and spacing between other elements.
